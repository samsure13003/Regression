# 📊 Regression Models Portfolio (Python & scikit-learn)

🚀 **Recruiter-Ready Machine Learning Portfolio | Regression Algorithms Implemented from Scratch Using scikit-learn**

This repository demonstrates **hands-on, practical expertise in regression modeling**, implemented using **Python, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and scikit-learn**.
Each regression technique is developed in a **dedicated Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`)**, focusing on **model behavior, visualization, and real-world applicability** rather than theory alone.

---

## 🎯 Why This Project Matters

This project is designed to show recruiters that I can:

* ✅ Translate **machine learning theory into working code**
* ✅ Choose the **right regression model** for a given problem
* ✅ Diagnose **overfitting vs underfitting** using visualization
* ✅ Build **clean, readable, production-ready notebooks**
* ✅ Apply **ensemble learning** to improve model performance

This is not a tutorial copy — every notebook reflects **active experimentation and understanding**.

## 🧠 Regression Techniques Implemented

Each model is implemented, trained, and visualized independently:

* ✔ **Linear Regression** – baseline modeling & interpretation
* ✔ **Multiple Linear Regression** – multivariate prediction
* ✔ **Polynomial Regression** – non-linear pattern learning
* ✔ **Decision Tree Regression** – rule-based, high-variance modeling
* ✔ **Random Forest Regression** – ensemble learning & variance reduction
* ✔ **Support Vector Regression (SVR)** – margin-based regression
